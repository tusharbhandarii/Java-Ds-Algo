<h1>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Welcome to my GitHub repository! This project is dedicated to my journey of learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. Here, you'll find implementations of various algorithms and data structures, along with practice problems and solutions.

<h2>About Me</h2>
Hi, I'm <b>Tushar Bhandari</b>, and I'm currently learning DSA with Java. This repository is a way for me to track my progress, share my code, and hopefully help others who are also learning DSA.

<h2>Repository Structure</h2>
src/: Contains Java source files for different data structures and algorithms.
docs/: Documentation and notes on key concepts, problem-solving techniques, and explanations of the implementations.
tests/: Unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implementations.
problems/: Solutions to various practice problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and others.

<h2>Topics Covered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Arrays and Strings</li>
  <li>Linked Lists</li>
  <li>Stacks and Queues</li>
  <li>Trees and Graphs</li>
  <li>Sorting and Searching Algorithms</li>
  <li>Dynamic Programming</li>
  <li>Recursion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
To run the code locally:
<ol>
  <li>Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/tusharbhandarii/Java-Ds_Algo.git</li>
  <li>Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).</li>
  <li>Run the Java files or the test cases to see the implementations in action.</li>
</ol>
